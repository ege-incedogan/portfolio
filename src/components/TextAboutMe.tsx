            Hello my name is Ege IncedoÄŸan, a self-taught developer with a
            background in Finance and Accounting, ready to bring a unique blend

            After dedicating years to pursuing my finance degree, I came to the
            realization that it wasn't the career path I wanted for my future.
            Instead, I decided to follow my passion and explore coding.

            To my delight, I discovered a deep love for programming, and I've
            since honed my developer skills to a confident level. Now, I am
            eagerly anticipating the opportunity to collaborate and work
            together with you.
